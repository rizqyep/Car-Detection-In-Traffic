# Car-Detection-In-Traffic
This is a simple car detection in moving traffic code written in python using opencv library and cascader from haarcascade 

I am open to contribution to make this code even better 

There are several option for developers who might want to contribute in this code : 

- Adding text for every object detected 
- Adding car counter to count how many car currently in frame 
- Adding line-rule for further development such as : 
  - Traffic light stopping area violation
  - Traffic light violation
